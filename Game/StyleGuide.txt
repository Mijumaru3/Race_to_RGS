Style Guide for Code & Naming Conventions:

-a script will be divided into three parts: 
       variables at the top, grouped by their use
       functions that are defined by Unity
       functions have been created
  the three parts will be divided by a comment of a line of equal signs (=) and a line comment of which part it is
-the created functions section will have two parts:
       public functions
       private functions
  the three parts will be divided by a comment of a line of minus signs (-) and a line comment on which part it is

-variable names will begin with a lower case letter and if they are longer than one word then each subsequent
 word will have the first letter capitalized (no spaces or underscores between the words)
 examples: 
          one word name: player
          multi-word name: aVariableName
  the same rule for variables also applies to function parameters
  
-function names will begin with an upper case letter and if longer than one word then each subsequen word will
 have the first letter capitalized (no spaces or underscores between the words)
 examples:
          one word name: void function()
          multi-word name: void NameOfFunction()
        
-names of scripts will be similar to function names except that they will end with: _Script
 examples:
          one word name: Player_Script
          multi-word name: BulletDisplay_Script
-names of materials will be similar to functions except that they will end with: _mat
 examples:
          one word name: Background_mat
          multi-word name: RubberEnemy_mat
